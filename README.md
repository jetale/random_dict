# Random Dict

### Extension of Python's Dictionary - RandomDict can return a random key from the dictionary in O(1) time and can also return the length of the dictionary in O(1)

This is inspired by an question I was asked in an coding interview 






## Usage -

  - It can be used normally like a python dictionary for all the functionalities
  
  - The added functionalities can be accessed using 
  ```
    - RandomDict.get_random_key()
    - RandomDict.__len__()
  ```




## TODO -

  - [ ] Add documentation and comments in the code
  - [ ] Test the functionalities more extensively
  - [ ] Extend readme.md
